                <p>Gentle giants of the jungle, elephants are known for their remarkable intelligence, deep emotional capacity, and strong social bonds. As the largest land animals on Earth, they roam diverse habitats including savannas, forests, deserts, and marshes across Africa and Asia. Elephants live in close-knit herds, usually led by a matriarch, and display behaviors such as cooperation, empathy, and even grief. They use their powerful trunks for breathing, smelling, touching, grasping, and communicating. Their low-frequency rumbles can travel several kilometers, allowing them to stay in contact with distant members of their group.</p>

Through educational displays, live demonstrations, and interactive exhibits, guests can gain insight into the complex lives of elephants. You’ll learn how they care for their young, the challenges they face in the wild, and how they contribute to the ecosystems they inhabit. Conservation efforts around the world are focused on protecting these incredible animals from threats such as poaching for ivory, habitat destruction, and human-wildlife conflict.
